    A crystallographic spacegroup's symmetries encoded in Hall's notation

    Hall proposed a compact unambiguous notation for the representation of the
    generators of a spacegroup. Within his notation each motion is comprised of
    a character with one or more subscripts and superscripts which describe its
    order, unique axis, and translation. The notation specifies that, depending
    on the position of a motion and details of any preceding motion, some or
    all of the sub- and superscripts can be omitted. The :class:`HallSymbol` has
    been written to handle the logic necessary to decode a Hall symbol into its
    equivalent motions.
    An added complication arises when the Hall symbol is encoded as an ASCII
    string. Namely, there are no sub- or superscript glyphs and some scheme must
    be enacted to represent them.
