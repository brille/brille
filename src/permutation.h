Linear Assignment Problem algorithms can only handle real-valued costs.
Since it is desirable to make assignments of complex-valued data we
need means by which to identify the underlying real data type.

/*! \brief Use Munkres' Assignment algorithm to determine a permutation

For two arrays of data, located in memory at `centre` and `neighbour`, and each
representing `Nobj` sets of  `Nel[0]` scalars, `Nel[2]` vector elements, and `Nel[3]`
matrix elements, determine the sorting permutation that maps the elements at
`centre` onto the same global mapping as the sorting permutation already stored
at `permutations[neighbour_idx]`. The resultant global permutation is stored
at `permutations[centre_idx]`.

Each array of data to be compared must be formatted as:

      [ 0{(0‚Ä¶Nel[0]-1)(0‚Ä¶Nel[2]-1)(0‚Ä¶Nel[3]*Nel[3]-1)}
        1{(0‚Ä¶Nel[0]-1)(0‚Ä¶Nel[2]-1)(0‚Ä¶Nel[3]*Nel[3]-1)}
        ‚ãÆ
        Nobj-1{(0‚Ä¶Nel[0]-1)(0‚Ä¶Nel[2]-1)(0‚Ä¶Nel[3]*Nel[3]-1)} ]

The function constructs an `Nobj`√ó`Nobj` cost matrix, where each element is
given by

      C·µ¢‚±º = Wscl√ó‚àë‚Çñ‚Çã‚ÇÄ·¥∫À¢·∂úÀ°‚àö(centre[i,k]-neighbour[j,k])
          + Wvec√óùî£·µ•(centre_vec[i],neighbour_vec[j])
          + Wmat√óùî£‚Çò(centre_mat[i],neighbour_mat[j])

where `Wscl`, `Wvec`, and `Wmat` are weight factors for adjusting the relative
cost of the scalar, vector, and matrix differences, respectively;
ùî£·µ• is the vector cost function; and ùî£‚Çò is the matrix cost function.

The vector cost function is selected by `vec_cost_func` to be one of:
the angle between the vectors, the length of the difference between the vectors,
or one minus the inner product of the vectors.

The matrix cost function is the Frobenius norm of the difference between the
two matrices.

@param centre The values to be sorted by the determined permutation
@param neighbour The values against which the `centre` values are compared
@param Nel The number of scalars, eigenvector elements, vector elements, and matrix elements per object
@param Wscl The cost weight for scalar elements
@param Weig The cost weight for eigvenvectors
@param Wvec The cost weight for vectors
@param Wmat The cost weight for matrices
@param span The number of elements per object, `Nel[0]+Nel[2]+Nel[3]*Nel[3]`
@param Nobj The number of objects at each of `centre` and `neighbour`
@param[out] permutations Contains the global permutation sorting for the
                         neighbour and is where the centre permutation is stored
@param centre_idx The index into `permutations` where the output is stored
@param neighbour_idx The index into `permutations` to find the neighbour permutation
@param eig_cost_func Used to select the eigenvector cost function:
                      0 --> `vector_angle`
                      1 --> `vector_distance`
                      2 --> `1-vector_product`
                      3 --> `abs(sin(hermitian_angle))`
@param vec_cost_func Used to select the vector cost function:
                      0 --> `vector_angle`
                      1 --> `vector_distance`
                      2 --> `1-vector_product`
@returns `true` if the permutation was assigned successfully, otherwise `false`
