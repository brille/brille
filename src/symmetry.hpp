/*! \brief The spacegroup symmetry operations of a lattice

The spacegroup of a crystallographic lattice is comprised of a set of symmetry
operations, each of which is a Motion.
The operations form a group, that is for any two elements M·µ¢ and M‚±º ‚àà G their
product M·µ¢‚±º = M·µ¢M‚±º is also a member of the group, M·µ¢‚±º ‚àà G.

Since the group is complete and all M·µ¢‚±º ‚àà G we can reduce the Motions used to
describe a group to a subset which are able to *generate* the group through
repeated multiplication. Any such subset are the generators of the group and
these can be obtained from a Symmetry operation via a class method.

If only the generators are specified when a Symmetry object is constructed then
the full group can be obtained via a class method.
