"""Python module :py:mod:`brille`
=================================

This module provides access to the C++ brille library which can be used to
interact with spacegroup and pointgroup symmetry operations, to determine the
first Brillouin zone for a given real space crystallographic lattice, to
find *an* irreducible polyhedron from the first Brillouin zone and the
pointgroup operations of a spacegroup, to construct polyhedron-filling connected
point networks, and to perform linear-interpolation of user-provided data for
any reciprocal space point at a symmetry-equivalent position within the
connected point network.
